Set of practical tasks for course of system software

## task_01
Simple example of lexical and syntax analyzer. Without building AST (*abstract syntax tree*).

### What you have to do:
- rewrite synt structure (set more encapsulated);
- add structure for work with variables;
- add variable check (check of existen);
- add '+' and '-' operations (with variadic number of values);
- add function of error information (must pass the number line of code with error, type of error);
- rewrite work with table of lexemes (get lexemes directly from table);
- implement all 'TODO' tips (start with `TODO: Here you have to ...`);


### How work with repo
You have to **fork** this repository, create your **branch** and complete tasks. **All changes** you will be **commit** and **push** in your **forked repository**.
After you make sure that everything works, you send **pull request** to **this** repository.
To work with *git* you should to use [Github client](https://desktop.github.com/) (*nix systems already have git CLI client).
